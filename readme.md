# GAP Species Information Builder

This repository contains code for working with the GAP Species Models (or Habitat Maps). Notebooks and scripts here deal with issues in the catalog for these resources in ScienceBase and handle interactions with the Taxonomic Information Registry. Some of the scripts are one-time processes used to address issues and others will be fed into automated back-end algorithms for keeping everything up to date and usable.
